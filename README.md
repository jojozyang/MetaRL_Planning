Code for replicating the model in Jensen et al., 2023, A recurrent network model of planning explains hippocampal replay and human behavior. 


Some basic features of the model: 
1. A2C Actor Critic Policy Gradient RL
2. A world model is learned to predict the agent's next location and reward
3. Recurrent nueral network (RNN) based
